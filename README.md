## Project Overview
Energy demand forecasting is crucial for optimizing energy distribution and avoiding wastage. In this project:
- Historical energy demand data is processed and analyzed.
- Advanced machine learning algorithms, including **XGBoost**, are applied for predictive modeling.
- Time series techniques are utilized to capture temporal patterns in energy consumption.

## Features and Methodology
- **Time Series Analysis**: Extracting seasonality, trend, and noise components from the data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating features like lagged values, rolling means, and time-based attributes (hour, day, month, etc.).
- **Modeling with XGBoost**:
  - Hyperparameter tuning to optimize performance.
  - Handling missing values and outliers in the dataset.
- **Evaluation**:
  - Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
  - Cross-validation for robust evaluation.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`, `numpy` (Data manipulation and analysis)
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` (Visualization)
  - `XGBoost` (Machine learning model)
